# Bulking & cutting

Together with cutting, bulking is a strategy used for better tone, definition
and muscle mass. Bulking focuses on putting on weight and getting bigger, while
a cut focuses on trimming body fat and getting leaner. Bulking is usually
followed by cutting, and vice versa.

The choice for either a bulk or a cut depends on the current state of the
athlete's body. When more muscle mass is desired, and the athlete's body fat
percentage is not higher than desired, a bulk would be a fitting choice. During
the bulk, the athlete will gain weight (ideally in the form of muscle mass), and
then follow the bulk by a cut to trim the excess fat and reveal the muscle mass.

## Cycle duration

In general, at least a 4-6 week cycle is recommended. Spending less time than
that in a bulk or cut cycle is unlikely to produce any noticeable results.

Longer cycles can be even more effective, with the most effective bulking cycles
lasting from 3 to 4 months, if not longer, while effective cutting cycles last
from 8 to 12 weeks.

## Bulking

When bulking, the athlete will eat more calories than they burn. This is called
a caloric surplus. The extra calories are used by the body to build muscle mass.
The extra weight that the athlete can put on can also come in the form of fat.
This fat is usually undesired for aesthetic reasons, and will be trimmed during
the cut cycle. The increase in fat percentage can be limited by proper balancing
of micronutrients, but it is not entirely avoidable.

Another important factor to ensure the increase of muscle mass during a bulk is
the intensity of the athlete's workouts. It is very important that the athlete
continues to train with heavy weights during the bulk. This will help your body
with allocating all those extra calories towards building muscle mass.

### Caloric surplus

During a bulk, aim for 110% of your base caloric needs. This is enough calories
to add muscle mass without adding too much extra fat. Focus on eating a lot of
protein, and cut out processed foods. Other foods to focus on are whole grain
carbohydrates, healthy fats, as well as plenty of minerals and vitamins like
omega-3.

Here is a starting point for bulk macros:

| Macro         | % of daily caloric intake |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Protein       | 35%                       |
| Fat           | 35%                       |
| Carbohydrates | 30%                       |

## Cutting

When cutting, the athlete will eat less calories than they burn. This is called
a caloric deficit. Your body will have to reduce its own mass to make up for the
decrease in calories. This is a natural process. During the cut, the goal is to
reduce the body's fat percentage, while retaining as much muscle mass as
possible.

During the cut, the athlete's focus during training will be higher reps, lower
weights, and cardio. The cardio will help burn extra calories, while the higher
reps will help retain muscle mass.

### Caloric deficit

The protein and fat intake would be the same as during the [[#Caloric
surplus|caloric surplus]]. The macros will be different though, because the
athlete will decrease the carbohydrates intake to create a caloric deficit.
