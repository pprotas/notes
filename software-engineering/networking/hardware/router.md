# Router

A router is a hardware device that can connect a LAN to the Internet. Your ISP
will provide the cable that connects your router to the Internet.

Often, routers that are provided by ISPs are actually a combination of a router,
a switch, an AP and a modem.

## Routing Table

Each router has a routing table, which sends packets to the correct destination,
using the best path. The hardware within the router calculates these routes
using algorithms.

### Congestion Control

There is a term called Congestion Control, which refers to the routers choosing
a less direct path towards the destination in favor of better flow of traffic,
by distributing the packet density more evenly over the network.
