# Switch

A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a local area
network (LAN), by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to
the destination device.

Devices can connect to a switch using cables, but an AP can serve as a wireless
switch. You connect the cables to the LAN ports on the switch.

A switch examines the packets sent from one device, finds out the destination
device, and forwards that packet towards its destination.
