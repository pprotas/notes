# Local Area Network (LAN)

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers within a restricted area such as a residence, university, or office building.

All you need to create a LAN is a switch. In practice, most residences all over the world have a LAN by means of their router connecting all the devices in the house. These types of residential routers often contain a small switch.
