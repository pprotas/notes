# Internet

A global network of networks.

The internet we know is a global network of interconnected routers. These are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems.

The internet is a design philosophy, and an architecture, expressed in protocols.

## Network

A group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other. Networks are connected by cables, radio waves, satellites, and other methods.

Within a network, data is split up into smaller packets. These packets are sent to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original data.

### Packet

A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet. It contains the data, as well as information about where it came from and where it is going. The TCP/IP protocol is used to transmit packets over the internet.

### Submarine Cables

Around the entire globe, there are hundreds of thousands of miles of submarine cables that connect continents and countries together. These cables are responsible for transmitting data between different parts of the world. These cables are the primary way in which the global internet network is connected.

## Protocols

> At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols - [How does the internet work?](https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work)

Different protocols are used for different purposes. These protocols are used between devices for transmitting data.

To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

There are a bunch of other protocols, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol.
