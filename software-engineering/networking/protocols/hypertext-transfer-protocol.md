# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

A protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, the web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you've requested. The server sends an HTTP response back to the client.

## HTTP Secure (HTTPS)

An encrypted version of HTTP that is more secure. It is more secure because the transmitted data is encrypted using SSL/TLS. This provides an additional layer of security which helps with protecting sensitive information. These days, HTTPS is the standard and most websites use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
