# Domain Name System (DNS)

A protocol that translates domain names into IP addresses. This is a critical part of the internet infrastructure, as every time you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or other resource you've requested.

## Domain Name

A human-readable name that is used to identify a website. For example, "google.com".
