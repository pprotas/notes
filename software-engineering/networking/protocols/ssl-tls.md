# Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)

Protocols that encrypt data sent over the internet. Commonly used to provide
secure connections for applications such as web browsers, email clients, etc.

## Certificates

SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server.
They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a
trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.

## Handshake

During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server exchange information
to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure
connection.

## Encryption

Once the secure connection is established, data is encrypted using the
agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and
server.
