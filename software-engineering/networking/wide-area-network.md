# Wide Area Network (WAN)

A Wide Area Network (WAN) allows LANs in different locations to communicate as if they were in the same environment. Imagine two offices in different cities that should both have access to the same intranet. A WAN would connect these offices to each other.

A WAN is useful in situations that security is important. Since anyone can connect to the public internet, it is not secure. A WAN is a private network, so it is more secure.

The most straightforward way to create a WAN is using a VPN.
