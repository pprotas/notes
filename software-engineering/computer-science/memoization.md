# Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique that is primarily used to speed up computer programs by storing ([[caching|_caching_]]) the results of expensive function calls, and returning the cached value instead of re-running the function when the function is called again with the same arguments. Memoizing is a form of caching that is specifically applied to functions and their results with specific arguments.
