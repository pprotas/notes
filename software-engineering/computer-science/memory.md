# Memory

Computer memory is like a chest of drawers where information can be stored. You can store something in a drawer, and remember the address of this drawer. This is basically how a computer's memory works. Your computer has a huge amount of drawers, and each drawer has an address. Each time you want to store an item in memory, you ask the computer for some space , and it gives you an address where you can store your item.
