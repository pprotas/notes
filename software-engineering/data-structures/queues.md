# Queues

Queues are a data structure that allow you to add items to the end of the queue (_enqueue_) and remove items from the front of the queue (_dequeue_). Random access of elements like in [[arrays]] is not a feature of queues. This approach is known as _first-in-first-out_ (FIFO), as compared to the _last-in-first-out_ (LIFO) approach of [[stacks]].

Queues work just like they do in real life. If you queue up at the bank, you will (hopefully!) be served in the order you get your ticket. If you arrive first, you will be served first. If you arrive last, you will be served last. People that arrive after you will also be served after you.
