# Graphs

A graph models a [[sets|set]] of connections. It represents a network of _nodes_, which are also called _vertices_. These vertices are connected to each other by _edges_, which represent the distance between the nodes. Nodes connected by an edge are called _neighbors_. Graphs are a way to model how different things are connected to another.

Examples of graphs are networks of friends on social media, a map of roads between cities or the metro system of a city.
